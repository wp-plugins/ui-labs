Experimental WordPress admin UI features, shiny ones.


== Description ==

UI Labs is a plugin that offers experimental WordPress admin UI features with the aim of building upon and enhancing the default WordPress User Interface. All features are in a constant state of beta, there are no guarantees and a modern browser is mandatory!

These are unofficial core UI experiments - who knows what could happen?

= Features =

1. Colour-Coded Post Statuses - Ever had a page full of posts which were a mix of drafts, stickied posts, pending posts, and private posts? When you have a lot of different post statuses, it's hard to differentiate them all. Experiment #1 applies colour-coding to post statuses to make different types of posts easy to pick out with just a glance.


== Installation ==

You can either install it automatically from the WordPress admin, or do it manually:

1. Unzip the archive and put the 'ui-labs' folder into your plugins folder (/wp-content/plugins/).
2. Activate the plugin from the Plugins menu.


= Usage =

1. Activate
2. Enjoy
3. ???
4. PROFIT!
